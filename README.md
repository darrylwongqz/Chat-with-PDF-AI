## üí≥ Testing Pro Account

To test the Pro account upgrade functionality without using a real credit card:

1. Navigate to the upgrade page in the application
2. Click on the "Upgrade to Pro" button

   - Expiration Date: Any future date (e.g., 12/34)
   - CVC: Any 3 digits (e.g., 123)
   - Name and Address: Any values

This will simulate a successful payment and upgrade your account to Pro status in the test environment. The test card will not incur any actual charges.
